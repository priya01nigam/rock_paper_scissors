# rock_paper_scissors
DESCRIPTION
This code represents a basic implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game in Python. It starts by welcoming the player and prompting them to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors). The player's input is then validated to ensure a valid choice. The computer selects a random choice from the available options. The program then compares the choices to determine the winner based on the game rules and displays the outcome.
